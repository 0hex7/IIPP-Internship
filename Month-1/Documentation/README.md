# MITRE Engage Overview

MITRE Engage is a knowledge base developed by the MITRE corporation, initially known as MITRE Shield. It provides ACTIVE DEFENSE information based on ten years of adversary engagement experience. It was released to stimulate conversations about adversary engagement and ACTIVE DEFENSE, as well as ways in which defenders can employ active defense.



## Tactics and Techniques

The MITRE Engage matrix illustrates the relationship between techniques and tactics. It consists of:

- **Tactics:** The objectives of defenders.
- **Techniques:** How each defense can help achieve one or multiple tactics.

## Tactics Breakdown

1. **Prepare (Strategic Action):**
   - Strategic actions ensuring appropriate driving of operations with strategic planning and analysis.
   - Mapping to the Prepare and Understand phases of the 10-Step Process.

2. **Expose, Affect, and Elicit (Engagement Action):**
   - Traditional cyber denial and deception activities.
   - Mapping to the Operate phase of the 10-Step Process.

3. **Understand (Strategic Action):**
   - Ensuring defenders drive operations with strategic planning and analysis.
   - Mapping to the Prepare and Understand phases of the 10-Step Process.

1. **EXPOSE (Collect & Detect):**
   - Exposing adversaries on the network using deceptive activities for high-fidelity alerts.

2. **AFFECT (Prevent, Direct & Disrupt):**
   - Affecting adversaries with a negative impact on their operations.
   - Changing the cost-value proposition in cyber operations.

3. **ELICIT (Reassure & Motivate):**
   - Eliciting information about the adversary to learn about their Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).

## Engagement Operations (I will be choosing 'Affect' goal for the upcoming work)

### AFFECT Goal Overview

AFFECT is about changing the cost-value proposition in cyber operations for the adversary. For example, negatively impacting the adversary’s on-network operations to drive up the resource cost of doing operations.

### Engagement Goal: AFFECT

Engage defines three approaches to make progress towards the Affect goal:

1. **Prevent:**
   - Focuses on setting up mitigations that stop some portion of an adversary’s operation from even starting.

2. **Direct:**
   - Attempts to maneuver an adversary into a better position for the defender.

3. **Disrupt:**
   - Seeks to cause problems in an adversary’s operations.

## AFFECT Approaches and Techniques

### 1. Prevent

- **Goal:**
  - Stop all or part of the adversary’s ability to conduct their operation as intended.
- **Techniques:**
  - BASELINE, HARDWARE MANIPULATION, ISOLATION, NETWORK MANIPULATION, SECURITY CONTROLS.

### 2. Direct

- **Goal:**
  - Encourage or discourage the adversary from conducting their operation as intended.
- **Techniques:**
  - ATTACK VECTOR MIGRATION, PERIPHERAL MANAGEMENT, EMAIL MANIPULATION, LURES, MALWARE DETONATION, NETWORK MANIPULATION.

### 3. Disrupt

- **Goal:**
  - Impair an adversary’s ability to conduct their operation as intended.
- **Techniques:**
  - SOFTWARE MANIPULATION, ISOLATION, LURES, NETWORK MANIPULATION.


# Next Steps

For the next month, the implementation plan includes Baseline, Lures, Attack Vector Migration, and Email Manipulation techniques.
Also study about SSH Honeypots for the goal implementation.
